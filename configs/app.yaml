# Reported performance of the deployed dual-target Random Forest model.
# These numbers come from 5-fold stratified cross-validation on the full master dataset.
model_performance:
  precision: 0.875       # Of all alerts raised, 87.5% were genuine near-misses
  recall: 0.986          # The system caught 98.6% of actual dangerous events
  f1_score: 0.927        # Harmonic mean of precision and recall
  model_type: "Random Forest"
  targets: "dual (preventive + immediate)"
  prediction_lead_time_s: 4.0     # How far ahead the preventive target looks
  ttc_threshold_s: 2.0            # TTC below this triggers the immediate danger label
  cv_folds: 5
  feature_count: 11
  training_sessions: 129          # Number of annotated sessions in the master dataset
  rolling_window_s: 2.0           # Rolling average window used in feature engineering
